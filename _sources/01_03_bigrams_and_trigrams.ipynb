    "Let's take a moment and step away from the subject of this textbook, topic modeling. Instead, let's think about language, the essential medium of topic modeling. This notebook will be exclusively about one aspect of langauge: bigrams and trigrams. When we use words, those words correspond to something distinct.\n",

    "If I use the word apple, you likely are thinking of something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/apple.png\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Apple is a simple word, yet it can mean different things in different contexts. What if I said the following: \"My Apple is better than a PC.\" Now, what image comes to mind? Perhaps this?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/apple_computer.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of textual ambiguity. Syntactical context helps eliminate textual ambiguity. Apple is a single word here that contains a single concept. It's a relatively simple word. Perhaps one of the earliest a native speaker of English learns as a child. And yet it has textual ambiguity. Because \"apple\" is a single word, it is known as a unigram. A **unigram** is a single word that represents a single concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Textual ambiguity, however, occurs in more dynamic ways when we think about concepts beyond the single span of a single word. In this notebook, we will focus on two such cases that are essential for natural language processing: bigrams and trigrams. **Bigrams** are two words that contain a distinct meaning when used together, while **trigrams** are three words that contain a distinct meaning when used together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding bigrams and trigrams are essential because in order for a computer to truly understand langauge the way a human does, it must be able to understand the nuances of a single word and how a word's meaning not only shifts in context, but shifts in meaning when used in conjunction with other words."

    "As noted above, a bigram is a combination of two words that have a distinct meaning. To demonstrate this, let us consider quickly the word \"French\". A single word, that may have multiple meanings. Perhaps the word French refers to the language:\n",

This two words when combined have a distinct concept. Now, you may be thinking of this:\n",
