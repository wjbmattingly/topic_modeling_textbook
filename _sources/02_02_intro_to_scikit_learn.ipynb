    "In this notebook, you will meet a powerful and important Python library: Scikit-Learn, or Sklearn (often pronounced S-K-Learn). For humanists, Sklearn is a library that is used when necessary. It is rarely a library that one devotes significant time to learning. This, however, drastically limits the capabilities of the humanist. While sklearn is more often used in the sciences, its potential for use in the humanities is vast, especially in when it comes to certain tasks in text analysis, namely topic modeling and data clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we explore TF-IDF in Part Two of this notebook, we will see the power of Sklearn as we use it to perform two tasks. First, we will use it to perform TF-IDF. This will get all documents to a set of a key words. We will then use those key words to harness another feature of Sklearn, KMeans. We will use KMeans to cluster the keywords to identify topics present in our sources. If you are unsure what all this means, by the end of Part Two, you will not only understand these concepts and terms, you will also know how to do it in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin to explore the code, however, it is vital that you have a basic understanding of the key library, Sklearn, its features, and how to install it correctly. This notebook will cover these ideas as well as some of the potential problems you may encounter while installing Sklearn on a Windows PC."

    "**Scikit-Learn** is a powerful Python library often used by the sciences. In the sciences, Scikit-Learn is a necessary library and one that is encountered early in coding courses on Python. The reason? Because it provides users with easy-to-implement algorithms. An **algorithm** is nothing more than an algebraic formula designed to have a specific output based on a set of rules designated as variables. Rather than writing out algorithms manually in Python, Scikit-Learn allows users to select an algorithm and pass variables to the algorithm. Most importantly, it allows for significant and custom tweaking to these algorithms so that complex tasks can be achieved often in a single line of code.\n",
    " \n",
    "In addition, Scikit-Learn provides easy-to-use clustering algorithms so that in a single line of code a user can cluster data and achieve complex analysis relatively simply. In the image below, we can see an example of K-Means clustering, discussed in more depth in Notebook 01.02.\n",
